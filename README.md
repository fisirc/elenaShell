Pocket Charity is a web app designed to connect NGOs and sponsors (donating organizations) through an interactive and collaborative platform. This project aims to facilitate donations and align NGO projects with the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

You can see the NGOs and sponsors activity in the `dashboard` and visit each one's `profiles` with our `searcher`. Additionally, you can visualize NGOs and sponsors filtered by SDGs using the `Graph Viewer` and through an interactive map with the `Geo Viewer`.
